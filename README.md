This repo contains my attempts at solving some problems in the CSES Problem Set: https://cses.fi/problemset/

The CSES website supports quite a few langauges, but doesn't include Go. The "Runner" tool allows me to run a Go version of a problem against the test data set for a problem.
It can be used with other languages as well, just pass in the command to run.
